## README

This project is based on the UCI HAR Dataset, so make sure you have it downloaded in your working directory to succesfully run the script.

This repository includes: 
- README.md
- CodeBook.md
- run_analysis.R

In the CodeBook file, you can find the description of the variables. 
The run_analysis file contains the script that you need to run in R to obtain the tidy dataset. 

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.
